Undefined — A starting point for Ghost theme developers
=======================================================

## !!! THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED TO https://git.sr.ht/~curiositry/undefined-ghost-theme !!!

**This starter theme has everything you need to get started making themes for the Ghost blogging platform.**

*Looking for a nice theme that’s ready to go? Check out my other themes, [Mnml](http://github.com/curiositry/mnml-ghost-theme) (free), [Laminim](https://creativemarket.com/Curiositry/1037280-Laminim-%E2%80%94-Ghost-Theme-for-Bloggers) (premium), and [Weblog]() (premium). If you would like to support my work developing free Ghost themes, use this referral link to **[sign up for Ghost(Pro) hosting for your blog](https://ghost.org/?via=curiositry)**.*

## Features

- **Bring your own CSS**. Front end developers are persnickety about their CSS frameworks: Some write everything from scratch, some roll their own framework that they use in all their projects (in my case, Sassify), and some use Bootstrap or Foundation or the current *framework-de-jour*. Undefined leaves all the styling to you: just drop your styles in `main.css` and you’re ready to go.

- **Responsive!** Because plain HTML is responsive *by default*.

- **Ready for Ghost 5.0 and beyond.** With undefined as a starting point, your theme is ready for the future.

- **Super modular.** Undefined makes use of handlebar partials to break things into neat, self-contained modules. Don’t want a subscribe form? Remove the `subscribe-widget` module without code-surgery.

- **Ready-to-roll**. Everything you’d expect from a Ghost theme is built in: A homepage with post teasers, author pages, tag pages, navigation menu, subscribe form, metadata, and more. Free cars don’t often come with gas in tank and air in the tires!

- **Smart defaults.** You can customize undefined in a thousand different ways, and it makes the job easier by being as close to neutral as possible. It’s like a dark grey suit — it’s not flashy, but it can go anywhere. You get a menu with a list of links, a little author bio below each post, reasonable metadata below the title. You get a footer with copyright date and theme attribution. You get all the files that Ghost requires (post page, index, etc) to run, plus all the files a blog needs to be complete (tag and author pages, etc). Nothing fancy, but very respectable.

- **Cleanly coded and comprehensively commented**. The code is nice and clean, W3C valid, and scores "A" on Google pagespeed.

## Getting started

Getting started building on Undefined is as easy as one, two.

- { 1 }: **Download this starter theme by [clicking here](https://github.com/curiositry/undefined-ghost-theme/archive/master.zip), or clone it with Git**:

```
git clone https://github.com/curiositry/undefined-ghost-theme.git
```

- { 2 }: **Add your custom styles.** Open up main.css and add your styles. Or, fire up your CSS pre- or post-processor of choice and replace `main.css` with your compiled stylesheet.


*If you plan on using the enabling memberships and subscriptions, you will also need to upload the included `routes.yaml` from the "Labs" tab of your blog’s admin panel.*

## Screenshot

Undefined is completely unstyled: no custom fonts, no fancy colours, no nothing. The beauty of undefined is in the code, not the design. But unstyled HTML has a rugged beauty of its own — in fact, to my eyes it looks *better* than many ~~of the digital junkyards piled high with CSS + JavaScript~~ “modern” websites!
